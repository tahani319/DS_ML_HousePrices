#### **Description:**


This is a repository of my data science machine learning project that I worked on 
as part of immersive data science course with Misk Academy.

* EDA 
* data visualization  
* Features Engineering 
* Linear regression 
* Priciple components regression 
* partial least square regression
* Decision trees
